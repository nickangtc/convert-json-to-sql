# Convert JSON into SQL

Simple Node script that takes in JSON from a `.json` file and converts them into `INSERT INTO...` SQL queries, outputting the result into a specified `.sql` file.

Note: This is not a general purpose script. It's merely a template that you'll have to modify code in order to adapt to different use cases.
